# Lightweight Cryptographic Ciphers (LWC) for IoT Repository

Welcome to the Lightweight Cryptographic Ciphers (LWC) for IoT repository! This repository contains Java implementations of various Lightweight Cryptographic Ciphers designed to offer secure and efficient cryptographic operations with low resource requirements.

## Contents

The repository includes the following LWC ciphers:

1. TWINE Cipher
2. HIGHT Cipher
3. CLEFIA Cipher
4. RSA Cipher
5. AES Cipher

Each cipher is implemented as a separate Java class, accompanied by relevant examples showcasing encryption and decryption methods. Additionally, the repository provides a MainLWCCiphers class to demonstrate calling the functions of all the ciphers.

## Usage

To use the ciphers, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your Java IDE or compile the Java files manually.
3. Modify the `MainLWCCiphers.java` file to customize plaintext, key, and other parameters as needed.
4. Run the `MainLWCCiphers` class to see the encryption and decryption results for each cipher.

Please note that this repository is intended for educational purposes and does not cover all aspects of production-grade cryptography. For practical use, consider using well-established cryptographic libraries.

## Contributing

Contributions to this repository are welcome! If you have ideas for additional LWC ciphers, improvements to existing implementations, or bug fixes, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

Before contributing, please ensure that your changes comply with the repository's coding standards and licensing.

Happy coding!
